Operating systems provide an interface for users to interact with.
Interfaces can be either graphic or command-line.
Graphic interfaces has menus, tiles, icons, and other graphic items to interact with.
Command-line interfaces are more visually basic, and require typed commands and prompts to carry out instructions.

Operating systems also manage user accounts and passwords.
Each account has a unique user name to identify it.
Usually one of the users is considered an administrator that has more control over the device and network settings.
The administrator can also control how much access other users have.
